What happened so far?
whats happening now - configure flutter 

## Configure Flutter

dart and flutter are installed -> following flutter.dev/get-started/install
after recommended installation method (see part 1) run flutter doctor
 -> all good? gratz, move ahead!
 -> error? here is my experience
    - Android SDK instlled?
    - Command line tools (use java 8 default, otherwise error)
    - android licence (also use java 8!)
    - ignore chrome if you dont want to develop web content
    - connected device -> use ur own smartphone or install kvm according to your OS instructions (heavier process on linux machines) see [flutters setup guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux#set-up-the-android-emulator) and [android studio setup guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)
    - i manage emulators on command line using `flutter emulators` and Android SDK tools (sounds unnecessary complicated? it is)
