Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Markus. I am a 26 year old Computer Science student from Germany. 
The most interesting field in CS for me is Programming Languages. For myself, I
feel most confident in Golang at the moment.

## What is this About?

> *"Yet another programming blog.."* ðŸ˜’

Yes, this is my blog and it's mainly about programming and tech stuff.
But really, these posts serve as a coding diary for myself. Making it available to the public
will hopefully save someone some time who is running in the same problems as I do.
Or even bring someone else into programming, who knows.
